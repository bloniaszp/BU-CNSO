# The Computational Neuroscience Student Organization (CNSO) at Boston University
### Sponsored by Graduate Program for Neuroscience


#### Mission

The Computational Neuroscience Student Organization (CNSO) is a dynamic student-led initiative at Boston University committed to advancing the interdisciplinary field of computational neuroscience. With an academic ecosystem that is both diverse and synergistic, CNSO aims to bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental neuroscience. We collaborate closely with the Neuroscience Graduate Student Organization (NGSO) to ensure a comprehensive neuroscience educational experience that is unified across both campuses and transcends traditional boundaries between neuroscience and computational neuroscience.

#### Objectives

- **Facilitate Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: CNSO provides a platform for students from different research backgrounds to collaborate on projects that require a blend of computational and experimental approaches. 
- **Professional Development**: We organize workshops, seminars, and panels that highlight skill development for CNSO members or trainees in the broader Boston area. These events are tailored to empower students with the skills needed for academic and industry careers in computational neuroscience.
- **Community Outreach**: Through community engagement, CNSO aims to make neuroscience accessible to the general public and inspire the next generation of neuroscientists.

#### Activities

- **Monthly Socials**: CNSO organizes monthly socials where students can discuss their research, gain constructive feedback from peers and faculty, and more generally feel closely tied to the computational neuroscience community at Boston University.
- **Code Reviews**: To ensure rigorous and robust computational methods, CNSO conducts regular code reviews and offers mentorship in scientific programming, particularly targeted at first year Graduate Program for Neuroscience students..
- **Journal Clubs**: These are collaborative discussions between Faculty, Post-docs, and Graduate Students based on recent, high-impact publications in computational neuroscience, aiming to keep the community updated on the latest advancements in the field.
  
#### Interdisciplinary Synergy

In collaboration with NGSO, CNSO holds periodic events that bring together students and faculty from both neuroscience and computational neuroscience. These events serve as an invaluable opportunity for networking and friendship, while fostering a collaborative spirit that is essential for pushing the boundaries of neuroscience research.

#### Membership

CNSO is open to all Graduate Program for Neuroscience students at Boston University who have an interest in computational neuroscience, regardless of their primary field of study. We also welcome cross pollination with students from different departments at events and socials. Reach out to Patrick Bloniasz (pblonias [at] bu.edu, 2023-2024) to be added to the mailing list.
